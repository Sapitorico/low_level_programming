<div><h1>File IO (Input/Output)</h1>
Is a fundamental part of C programming. Programs often need to read and save data to files, and the standard C input/output library provides the tools to do this. This tool allows the programmer to work with text or binary files in the C programming language, allow opening, reading, writing and closing files, as well as performing other file management tasks.

This tool also offers several directives for file control, such as security directives, storage directives and access directives. These policies allow the programmer to control access to files, as well as permissions and the types of data contained in the files.

The standard C input/output library consists of several functions. For example, the fopen () function opens a file for reading or writing, while the fread () function reads data from an open file and the fwrite () function writes data to a file. Other file management functions include fclose (), which closes an open file, and fseek (), which moves the read/write pointer in a file. 

Some of these functions also allow you to manipulate the contents of a file, such as the fgetc () function, which reads one character at a time from an open file, and the fputc () function, which writes one character at a time to an open file. 

<h3>Open()</h3>
Is an input/output (I/O) function in C that allows a programmer to open a file for reading, writing, or updating. This function is part of the standard C file system (stdio.h). The open() function takes the necessary parameters to open a file. These parameters include the file name, the access mode (read, write or update) and the permissions for the file. If open() returns a non-zero (0) value, it means that the file has been successfully opened. If it returns a value equal to zero (0), it means that there is an error opening the file. The programmer must check the return value of open() to verify that the file was opened correctly.
