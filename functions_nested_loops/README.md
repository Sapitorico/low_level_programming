# C - Functions, nested loops
## Functions
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task and every program has at least one function that is **main** and all other less trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide your code into separate functions.
A function declaration tells the compiler about the name of a function, the return type and the parameters.
