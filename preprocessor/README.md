# C - Preprocessor
## compilation process
The compilation process in C is converting an understandable human code into a Machine understandable code and checking the syntax and semantics of the code to determine any syntax errors or warnings present in our C program. Suppose we want to execute our C Program written in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In that case, it has to go through several phases of compilation (translation) to become an executable file that a machine can understand.
