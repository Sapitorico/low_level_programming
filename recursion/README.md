# C - Recursion
Recursion is a method in which the solution to a problem depends on the solutions of instances of instances of the same problem.
It is the process of repeating elements in a self-similar fashion. 
If a program allows calling itself within the same function, then it is called a recursive function call.
Therefore a recursive function is one that calls itself.
When using recursion, an exit condition must be defined for the function, otherwise it will enter an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful for solving many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
