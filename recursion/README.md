# C - Recursion
Recursion is a method in which the solution to a problem depends on the solutions of instances of instances of the same problem.
It is the process of repeating elements in a self-similar fashion. 
If a program allows calling itself within the same function, then it is called a recursive function call.
Therefore a recursive function is one that calls itself.
When using recursion, an exit condition must be defined for the function, otherwise it will enter an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful for solving many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.

# Stack
The stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. The developer can use the stack in the following use cases.

Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.
Finding the correct path in a maze using backtracking.
Runtime memory management.
Recursion function.

# Flowchart of Recursion
In the following image, there is a recursive function inside which there is a recursive call that calls the recursive function until the condition of the problem is true. If the condition gets satisfied, then the condition is false, and the program control goes for the remaining statements and stops the program.
