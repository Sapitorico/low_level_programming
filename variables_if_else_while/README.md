# Tasks 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing, 1. The last digit
**srand:** establishes the en argument for a sequence of pseudorandom integers
**rand:** returns a pseudorandom integer in the range 0 to RAND_MAX
```c
int main(void)
{
	int n;

	srand(time(0));				/*initializes and only calls it one bird per second*/
	n = rand() - RAND_MAX / 2;		/*returns an integer between 0 and RAND_MAX / 2*/
	return (0);
}
```
* The modulo **%** operator is a binary operator and only makes sense for integer numbers, if we perform the operation i % n the range of the result will be the remainder of the division between i and n a number between i and n -1. 
* ASCII is the standard encoding for the exchange of information, encoded in octal decimal and hexadecimal.
* ! Negate â€” used to negate or reverse a test or exit status
